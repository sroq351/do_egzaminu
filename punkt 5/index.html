<!--   

Create small application "My expenses" with form to add expenses with name and amount. 
 also lists of all added expenses and to each position add button "remove". Add also some text with total expenses amount.
JavaScript:
use array to save list of expenses
try to split JS logic into smaller files and use import/export syntax
don't use innerHTML to create DOM elements, instead of that use for instance createElement, appendChild etc.
try to use localStorage to save data. Use these saved data on first app loading (optional)
CSS:

you can use any layout but try to keep good UX/HTML practice (add labels to inputs, use form, 
use <ol>/<ul> elements for lists etc.)
use bootstrap or any other framework to style your elements 
(you can use also additional custom css but first of all you should use some framework)
